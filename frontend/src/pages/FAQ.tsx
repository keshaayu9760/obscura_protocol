    q: 'What tokens can I trade with?',
    a: 'Veil Strike v6 supports three tokens: ALEO (native Aleo credits), USDCx (USD-pegged stablecoin), and USAD (algorithmic stablecoin). Each token runs on its own dedicated Leo smart contract — veil_strike_v6.aleo, veil_strike_v6_cx.aleo, and veil_strike_v6_sd.aleo respectively.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is Veil Strike?',
    a: 'Veil Strike is a privacy-first prediction market protocol on the Aleo blockchain. Using zero-knowledge proofs, it keeps trader identities, position sizes, and payouts fully encrypted on-chain. Supports event prediction markets and Strike Rounds across 3 token types.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does governance work?',
    a: 'Any user can submit governance proposals: approve resolvers, request treasury withdrawals, update fees, or override markets. Others vote for or against. Governance is live on-chain via submit_proposal and cast_vote transitions but is still evolving — more voting mechanisms, quorum rules, and timelock controls are planned.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What are Strike Rounds?',
    a: 'Strike Rounds are 15-minute price prediction markets where you bet UP or DOWN on crypto prices (BTC, ETH, ALEO). The Round Bot automatically creates 3 concurrent markets every 15 minutes using delegated proving. After the timer expires, it compares oracle start vs end price and calls flash_settle on-chain — all markets are settled, even empty ones. Your position and payout are fully private via ZK proofs.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is privacy maintained?',
    a: 'All transactions generate zero-knowledge proofs locally in your browser. Your positions, balances, and trading activity are hidden from other users and observers. Only the aggregate market state (prices, liquidity) is public.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What fees does the protocol charge?',
    a: 'Total trading fee is 2%: 0.5% protocol fee, 0.5% market creator fee, and 1.0% liquidity provider fee. Aleo network gas fees also apply to each transaction.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this on mainnet?',
    a: 'Veil Strike is currently deployed on Aleo testnet (Wave 4). All tokens are testnet tokens with no real-world value. Mainnet deployment is planned after governance and privacy improvements are finalized.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I provide liquidity?',
    a: 'On any market detail page, use the "Add Liquidity" panel to deposit tokens. You receive an encrypted LP token record representing your share. LPs earn the 1% LP fee on all trades. You can withdraw when the market resolves.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if I disagree with a market resolution?',
    a: 'You can contest an event market resolution within the 12-hour challenge window using contest_verdict. A minimum 5 ALEO bond is required. If the market is re-resolved in your favor, you recover the bond. Strike Rounds resolved via flash_settle bypass the challenge window by design.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I create my own market?',
    a: 'Yes! Go to the Create page to set up an event market with your question, outcomes, deadline, and initial liquidity. The market is created on-chain and appears in the list once confirmed by the indexer. Strike Rounds are created automatically by the Round Bot every 15 minutes.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does resolution work?',
    a: 'Strike Rounds are auto-resolved by the Round Bot every 15 minutes. The bot compares oracle start vs end prices and calls flash_settle on-chain via delegated proving (~30s). All rounds are settled on-chain — including empty ones to keep state clean. Admin can also manually resolve via the Admin page. For event markets, the resolver calls render_verdict then ratify_verdict after a 12-hour challenge window.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I get started?',
    a: 'Install the Shield Wallet browser extension, connect to Aleo testnet, get testnet ALEO from the faucet, then navigate to Markets for event predictions or Rounds for Strike Rounds.',
  },
